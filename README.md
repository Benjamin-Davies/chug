# Chug

The fastest way to consume Homebrew bottles.

## TODO List

- [ ] Command to update bottles
- [ ] Ensure that dependencies are up to date when adding packages

## Non-goals

These may change in the future, but for now I do not intend to support:

- Casks or building formulae from source
- Non-Homebrew sources
- Linux
